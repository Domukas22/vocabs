# ChatGPT testing explanation

Test this code for me. Please make sure to use the "renderHook" from @testing-library/react-native. Do not use anything from "@testing-library/react-hooks", instead use everything from "@testing-library/react-native", including "act", "waitFor" and so on. Do not use renderook it the test case doesn't require it. Each test name does not start with "should...", but rather numerated, following with a verb, for example: "1. Hides varaibles...", "2. Throws and error when...", "3. Handles undefined gracefully...".

## Make sure to cover all critical edge cases, including incorrect / undefined values returned, as well as other weird bugs you can think of.

# Naming convention

Objects or functions which return objects always have a noun at the end of the name, which is separated by a "_" and then noun is then written in caps. For example: allColor_NAMES, fetched_ITEMS, vocabItem_WRAP. All functions start with a verb in caps, followed by a "_" and then the rest of the name, for example: CLEAR_allFilters, ADD_vocabs, RESET_pagination. Boolean hooks are name like so: IS_loading / SET_isLoading, IS_fetching / SET_isFetching etc.
