The 'r\_' function updates should be used by a global useeffect, which listens to any kind of changes in the global 'changes' state. We have to do this, because:

1. The printed lists need to be updated when we adjust children vocabs
2. Actively printed vocab lsts need to be updated after we copy a public vocab (or lists)
